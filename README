ActsAsPublish
=============

This +acts_as+ extension provides the capabilities for publishing,
unpublishing and prepublish objects. The class that has this
specified needs to have a +published+ and +published_at+ columns
defined as boolean and datetime respectively on the mapped database
table.

It creates the following scopes:

- +published+
- +unpublished+
- +latest+

Example
=======

 new_table :posts do |t|
   t.string   :title
   t.boolean  :published, :default => true
   t.datetime :published_at
 end

 class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_publish
 end

 @posts = Post.unpublished
 @posts = Post.published.latest.limit(5)
 
 @post = Post.create(:published => false, :published_at => Time.now - 1.year)
 @post.published? # => false

 @post = Post.create(:published => true, :published_at => Time.now - 1.year)
 @post.published? # => true

 @post = Post.create(:published => true, :published_at => Time.now + 1.year)
 @post.published? # => false
